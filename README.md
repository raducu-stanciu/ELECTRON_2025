 DESCRIPTION
🍌 Flag Searching Track 🍉
Welcome to the Flag Searching Track — a three-part visual reasoning challenge where you’ll need to spot hidden flags using object detection, model fine-tuning and more!
All 4 Flags are found in 4 different images, hidden in the dataset attached to this challenge.
You receive:
•	A folder of ~5,000 images (COCO-style visuals).
•	A YOLOv8 model pre-trained on COCO classes (with no knowledge of dragon fruit).
•	A custom fruit detection dataset, which includes dragon fruit, snake fruit, and pineapple, with bounding boxes.
🟡 Track 3.1 - Flag 1: Banana Hunt
•	The flag is hidden inside an image that contains at least one banana.
🔴 Track 3.2 - Flag 2: Dragon Fruit Mystery
•	The flag is hidden inside an image containing a dragon fruit.
🟢 Track 3.3 - Flag 3: The Secret Fruit Quest
•	Inspired by the intriguing AI-generated image below, we've hidden a flag somewhere within the dataset. Take a moment to observe the image—what story does it tell?
•	Hint: the CLIP vision transformer might come in handy.
 
🟢 Track 3.4 - Flag 4: Pattern Recognition
•	The flag is hidden in an image with a specific pattern, representing the MaDENN logo, available here assets\task_4_template.png
•	You can use any method to find the image with the pattern



                                                 Ballpit 2.1
DESCRIPTION
🟡 Track 2.1 - Denoise challenge
You receive:
•	A noisy .mp4 video containing colored balls on a grid. Your task is to obtain the original clean image from the video through any denoising method you prefer.
Your submission:
•	A denoised image.


                                                Ballpit 2.2
DESCRIPTION
🔴 Track 2.2 - Count challenge
You receive:
•	The denoised image from Track 2.1.
Your task is to count the number of balls per color (you don’t need to label the colors — just count and sort them by frequency).
You are not told:
•	Which colors are used.
•	How many different colors are present.
Your submission:
•	A .npy (numpy) file with the list of ball counts sorted from most to least
